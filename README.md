# seq
An interactive MIDI sequencer in Python. It is useable from the python interactive shell and is supposed to invite live coding to create changing MIDI sequences on the fly.

# Ideas and Direction
I want to have a meta sequencer controlling a group of sequencers. The meta sequencer should send things like scale, root note, tempo and chord or a chord progression which then changes the note pool for the other sequencers.
